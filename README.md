## Overview:

We and our FoxOS ecosystem allows developers to thrive by being able to write NixOS-Like config to install all the packages you need with a single config file after installing the OS. Updates? No problem! You can just specify packages for install in the config so you can set the kernel version you want, its just as easy as that.

## Installation:

To install FoxOS, follow these steps:

1. Download the ISO from the Sourceforge Mirror.
2. Create a bootable USB drive using your preferred tool (e.g., Rufus, Etcher).
3. Boot your computer from the USB drive.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to install FoxOS.
5. (For Developers) To make a NixOS-Like deployment system, first install the OS on hardware or a VM then use CLCTool to execute the deployment / config scripts you have wrote; More info at [CLCTool](https://github.com/TechFox-Innovations/CLCTool)

## Conclusion:

Thank you for choosing FoxOS! We hope you enjoy using our distro as much as we enjoyed creating it!

Happy computing!
